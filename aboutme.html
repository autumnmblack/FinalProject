    <h4>My Passion</h4>

    <p> Hi! My name is Autumn Black and I am 21 years old from Ocean Springs, Mississippi! One of my biggest life passions is to travel! My dad is a colonel in the
        United States Airforce, so travel and moving has played a large role in my upbringing. Because of this, I have discovered that I love to experience the world
        around me and I have been so blessed with the opportunity to see a variety of different states and nations. Keep reading below to hear about my top 3 favorite 
        travel destinations!

<p class="bold"> My Top 3 Favorite Places in The World </p>

    <ol>
        <li>England
            <ul>
                <li>London, England is by far my most favorite city in the world. I feel like every time my family and I went to London, there was an incredible energy
                    pulsing through the streets. The city was alive with music, dancing, lights,laughter, and a contageous joy that made you never want to leave. </li> 
                <li>Another thing I loved about England was the summer. Summers in England felt like a never ending dream. The sun would be out until 11pm and then as the sun
                    would set, the sky would be painted with the most beautiful pinks and oragnes my eyes have ever seen. <br><br>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Samoa</li>
            <ul>
                <li> In the spring of 2023, I went on a study abroad to the south pacific. Not only was I blown away by the incredible nature, but my heart was touched
                    by the samoan culture and people.  </li>
                <li> For 3 weeks I lived with a samoan family and volunteered as an accounting tutor at the local high school. If Samoa taught me one thing, it is 
                    to love quickly and wholely. Everyone I met in Samoa readily accepted me as a part of their family and treated my like a friend they've had
                    for years. </li> <br><br>
                <img src="Images/samoa.JPG" height="400" alt="school in Samoa"> <br><br>
            </ul>
        <li>Fiji
            <ul>
                <li> I have a mom who is absolutely obsessed with the beach. Every family vaction or outing somehow leads to the beach. Therefore, I have a strong 
                    appreciation and love for the ocean, sea, and all of its elements. </li> 
                <li> If there was an ocean to beat all oceans, Fiji would top them all. The water was crystal clear, aqua blue, clean, warm, and just all around breathtaking.
                    At some point in my life I hope to return to Fiji and take my mom with me; I know she would fall in love and be in the highest degree of earthly ecstasy.
